Creating a website with front-end and back-end development, as well as database management

1. Planning :
    Decide on the technology stack you'll use for front-end (REACT) and back-end (a server-side language like Node.js.)

2. Front-End Development :
    Design the user interface for the website using HTML and CSS.
    Implement interactive features using JavaScript or a JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js.

3. Back-End Development :
    Set up a server using your chosen technology (e.g., Node.js with Express).
    Implement APIs for creating, updating, listing, and deleting offers.
    Handle authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized users can edit offers.

4. Database Setup :
    Choose a database system (MongoDB) to store offer and player data.
    Design the database schema to store offers, items, rules, player data, and scheduling settings.

5. Offer Management :
    Implement logic to create, update, and delete offers.

6. Testing :
    Test the website thoroughly to ensure that all features work as expected.

7. Deployment :
    Deploy the front-end and back-end to a web hosting service or server.
    Configure domain settings and security (HTTPS).

8. Maintenance :
    Regularly update and maintain the website to address bugs, security vulnerabilities, and to add new features.
